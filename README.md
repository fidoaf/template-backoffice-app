# Flutter Backoffice app template

A new Flutter multipurpose app with the following features:

* [Multi-platform](#cross-platform)
* [Responsive](#responsive-design)
* [Adaptative](#rich-content)
* [Multilanguage](#multilanguage)
* [Highly Customizable](#branding)

# Let's get started

## Cross platform

Same codebase for the most used platforms:

- Web 
- Android
- iOS
- Windows
- Linux

## Branding 

All the assets can be changed and adjust to the company's branding: logos, icons, images, labels, default configuration.

Right of the bat, the application identifies the company and the product.

### Theming

Easily tailor the application's theme to match the company's corporate color palette, also respecting the current system preferences.
The user can override the defaults in settings, and those changes will apply across executions.

## Multilanguage

Localization is not only a matter of a one-to-one text translation but also making sure that the labels and messages read natural.
i18n plural and gender specific translation achive that goal.

## Authentication

The authentication process is performed against a customizable webservice.

At the moment it's just a simple Bearer token system.
On the roadmap we have included integrations for OAuth 2.0 and magic link/passwordless.

The login form performs the most basic validation, even though the process can be tweaked to every project's needs.

## Responsive design

User interface that adapts to the screen size in order to improve the usability and readability of the content.

## Rich content

Infinite possibilities to display, manage and handle data from the webservice.

Useful rich widgets that help analyze both static and real-time data.
