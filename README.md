# Flutter Backoffice app template

A new Flutter multipurpose app with the following features:

* [Multi-platform](#cross-platform)
* [Responsive](#responsive-design)
* [Adaptative](#adaptative)
* [Multilanguage](#multilanguage)
* [Highly Customizable](#branding)

----

# Let's get started

## Cross platform

Same codebase for the most used platforms:

- Web 
- Android
- iOS
- Windows
- Linux

## Branding 

All the assets can be changed and adjust to the company's branding: logos, icons, images, labels, default configuration.

Right of the bat, the application identifies the company and the product.

## Multilanguage

Localization is not only a matter of a one-to-one text translation but also making sure that the labels and messages read natural.
i18n plural and gender specific translation achive that goal.

## Authentication

The authentication process is performed against a customizable webservice.

At the moment it's just a simple Bearer token system.
On the roadmap we have included integrations for OAuth 2.0 and magic link/passwordless.

The login form performs the most basic validation, even though the process can be tweaked to every project's needs.

## Responsive design

User interface that adapts to the screen size in order to improve the usability and readability of the content.
